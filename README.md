# SnakeProject
This is a simple recreation of the classic game, Snake within the .NET console. I could have used WinForms, MonoGame, or Unity but my goal was to learn how to code as much as possible from scratch. I enjoy challenges such as figuring out how to use platform invoke calls to directly write to the native consoleâ€™s buffer to speed up rendering.

I am actively working on refactoring this and making changes to increase clarity.
